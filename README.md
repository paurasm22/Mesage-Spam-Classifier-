Title: SMS / Email Spam Classifier

Description:
This project is a machine learning–based web app that classifies messages as Spam or Not Spam. It uses NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. The frontend is built using Streamlit, allowing users to type a message and instantly get a prediction.

Project Overview:
The classifier is trained on a labeled SMS dataset and uses text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. The processed text is converted into numerical vectors using TF-IDF, and the model predicts whether the message is Spam or Not Spam. The project is fully deployable on Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces.

Features:
• Real-time spam prediction
• Clean and simple UI
• Custom NLP preprocessing pipeline
• Lightweight and fast ML model
• Free deployment options

Project Structure:
Includes a Streamlit app file, trained model file, TF-IDF vectorizer, requirements file, and documentation.

Installation (these are the ONLY code blocks):

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

Deployment:
The app can be deployed easily on Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces by uploading the app file, model file, vectorizer file, and requirements file.

Inspired by the CampusX Spam Classifier project.

If you want, I can also generate:
• A shorter version
• A more professional corporate-style README
• A README with badges and screenshot placeholders

Just tell me!
